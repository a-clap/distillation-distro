IoT Distro (developed for https://wiki.banana-pi.org/Banana_Pi_BPI-M2_ZERO[BananaPi Zero]) for personal use.

== What is this?

Linux distro developed with Yocto. Just for personal use.
Tightly connected with https://github.com/a-clap/iot:[IoT].

=== What interesting I can find here?

* [x] *Linux 6.**. As BananaPi Zero has mainline kernel support it was quite easy
* [x] *TRNG hw support*. Some people claim that TRNG hw support in sun8i (H3) is not working reliably. Dunno, tested it with rngtest, works for me.
* [x] *Spidevs*. Way of adding spidev to devicetree.
* [x] *DeviceTree*. Way of modifying device tree.
* [x] *Container*. Dockerfile to create container for yocto distro development.
* [x] *Passing env to yocto*. Look at Makefile and _BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH_ADDITIONS_ - it is used to inject WLAN configuration to image.

Hopefully, there will be more :)
