Part of {distro-link}[distillation project].

== What is this?

My own Linux distro hand forged with Yocto. It is tightly connected with {distro-link}[software]

== On what hardware it runs?

Whole distro is based on https://wiki.banana-pi.org/Banana_Pi_BPI-M2_ZERO[Banana PI M2 ZERO] and motherboard of my project. The motherboard extends SBC with:

* 4x 24 V DC Digital Outputs on pins:
** PA6
** PA16
** P14
** P13

* DS3231-RTC
** I2C0 (PA12/PA11)

* ADS1115 ADC
** I2C1 (PA19/PA18) - with level translation from 3.3 V to 5 V DC

* 3x 3.3 V DC outputs on pins:
** PA20
** PA21
** PA2

* 1x 3.3 V DC input on pin:
** PA0

* SPI1 (MOSI-only) - dedicated for WS2812 leds
** PA15

* SPI0 (PC0/PC1/PC2) with two devices on it:
** (1) MAX31865
*** CS0 (PC3)
*** available as spidev on /dev/spidev0.0
*** with !DRDY pin on PL4-S

** (2) MAX31865 on CS1 (PC4)
*** CS1 (PC4)
*** available as spidev on /dev/spidev0.1
*** with !DRDY pin on PL2-S

* Ethernet:
** from TXN/TXP/RXN/RXP pins, which are available here:

.Banana PI EPHY pins
image::banana-eth.jpg[400,400,role=text-center]

* Three onewire buses on pins:
** PC7
** PA7
** PA8


* All 40 IOs (including not used ones) are available through 2x20 goldpin header
** Unused IO:
*** PA1
*** PA3
*** PA17
*** PA10
*** PA9

* XServer/Display:
** 7 inch touch display connected via HDMI and USB (touch)

== What interesting I can find here?

* [x] *Linux 6.2*. As BananaPi Zero has mainline kernel support so it was quite easy
* [x] *TRNG hw support*. Some people claim that TRNG hw support in sun8i (H3) is not working reliably. Dunno, tested it with rngtest, works for me.
* [x] *Spidevs*. Way of adding spidev to devicetree.
* [x] *Onewire*. Way of adding onewire to devicetree.
* [x] *DeviceTree*. Way of modifying device tree.
* [x] *Container*. Dockerfile to create container for yocto distro development.
* [x] *Passing env to yocto*. Look at Makefile and _BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH_ADDITIONS_ - it is used to inject WLAN configuration to image.

== TODO list
* [ ] Optimize boot time (right now it boots in around 10 seconds)
* [ ] OTA support
